## About The Project

Colophon is a social network dedicated to book lovers. The platform allows users to create virtual bookshelves to organize their readings (read, currently reading, and want to read), write reviews, give ratings, and share their progress with friends.

This repository contains the code for the **back-end API**, built with Node.js, Express, Prisma, and TypeScript. It is responsible for all business logic, database interactions, and user authentication.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Olliver-0/colophon-api.git](https://github.com/Olliver-0/colophon-api.git)

    cd colophon-api
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file.
    - Add the required environment variables:
      ```env
      DATABASE_URL=PASTE_YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE
      JWT_SECRET=PASTE_A_GENERATED_SECURE_RANDOM_STRING_HERE
      ```
5.  **Apply the database schema:**
    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```
6.  **Start the development server:**
    `bash
npm run dev
`
    The API will be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configure).
